      <t>This document defines a standard profile for Traffic Origin
      Authorizations (TOAs), a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
      content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
      A TOA is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying
      that an IP address block holder has authorized an Autonomous System (AS)
      to originate traffic using source IP addresses within the address
      block.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Source address validation (SAV) requires verifying that an AS has
      been authorized to originate traffic using one or more prefixes as the
      source IP address. A Traffic Origin Authorization (TOA) provides this
      function.</t>

      <t>The TOA makes use of the template for RPKI digitally signed object
      <xref target="RFC6488"/>, which defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax
      (CMS) wrapper <xref target="RFC5652"/> for a generic validation
      procedure for RPKI signed objects. Therefore, to complete the
      specification of the TOA (see Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6488"/>),
      this document defines:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The OID that identifies the signed object as being a TOA. (This
          OID appears within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo object
          as well as the content-type signed attribute in the signerInfo
          object.)</t>

          <t>The ASN.1 syntax for the TOA eContent. (This is the payload that
          specifies the ASes being authorized to originate traffic as well as
          the prefixes that the ASes may use as the source IP address.) The
          TOA eContent is ASN.1 encoded using the Distinguished Encoding Rules
          (DER) <xref target="X.690"/>.</t>

          <t>Additional steps required to validate TOAs (in addition to the
          validation steps specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The content of a TOA identifies a list of one or more ASes that have
      been authorized by the IP address block holder to originate traffic and
      a list of one or more IP address prefixes within the address block that
      will be used as the source IP address. The TOA and the ROA <xref
      target="RFC9582"/> have different intentions and contents because
      prefixes used as the source IP address in traffic (which is contained in
      TOAs) and prefixes advertised into the routing system (which is
      contained in ROAs) can be different and asymmetric for the same AS. In
      addition, many ROAs include allocated but not advertised prefixes, but
      these prefixes will not be used as the source IP address in traffic.</t>

      <t>The IP address block holder can register one or more TOAs to
      authorize which ASes can originate traffic using specific prefixes
      within the block as the source IP address. By registering TOAs, IP
      address block holders can protect their source IP addresses from being
      forged by attackers inside unauthorized ASes. ISP or enterprise AS
      operators can use TOAs to improve the accuracy and robustness of SAV
      (see Section 6 for details).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The TOA Content Type">
      <t>The content-type for a TOA is defined as id-ct-trafficOriginAuthz and
      has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.</t>

      <t>This OID MUST appear within both the eContentType in the
      encapContentInfo object and the content-type signed attribute in the
      signerInfo object (See <xref target="RFC6488"/>).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The TOA eContent">
      <t>The content of a TOA identifies a list of one or more ASes that have
      been authorized by the address block holder to originate traffic and a
      list of one or more IP address prefixes within the address block that
      will be used as the source IP address. A TOA is formally defined as:</t>

          <t>The IP address delegation extension <xref target="RFC3779"/> is

          TOA), and every IP address prefix in the TOA payload is contained
          within the set of IP addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP
          address delegation extension.</t>

          <t>The EE certificate's IP address delegation extension MUST NOT
          contain "inherit" elements as described in <xref
          target="RFC3779"/>.</t>

          <t>The Autonomous System identifier delegation extension described
          in <xref target="RFC3779"/> is not used in TOAs and MUST NOT be
          present in the EE certificate.</t>

          <t>The TOA content fully conforms with all requirements specified in
          Sections 2 and 3.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If any of the above checks fail, the TOA MUST be considered invalid
      and an error SHOULD be logged.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC6481"/>, <xref
      target="RFC6485"/>, <xref target="RFC6488"/>, and <xref
      target="RFC9582"/> also apply to the TOA object.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Enhancing SAV with TOAs">
      <t>Recent SAV mechanisms (e.g., EFP-uRPF <xref target="RFC8704"/>,
      BAR-SAV <xref target="draft-ietf-sidrops-bar-sav"/>, Bicone SAV <xref
      target="draft-li-sidrops-bicone-sav"/>) typically use BGP data, ROAs, or
      IRR route objects to identify the legitimate source IP address space of
      traffic coming from an adjacent AS. However, due to the asymmetry
      between prefixes used as the source IP address and prefixes advertised
      into the routing system as well as the impact of allocated but not
      advertised prefixes (as mentioned in Section 1), using BGP data, ROAs,
      and IRR route objects to perform SAV will have false positives (i.e.,
      blocking legitimate data packets) and false negatives (i.e., permitting
      spoofing data packets).</t>

      <t>By using TOAs, SAV can accurately identify whether an AS is
      authorized to use a specific source IP address to originate traffic. If
      an AS originates spoofinig traffic using a source IP address authorized
      to other ASes in TOAs, TOA-based SAV can identify and discard this
      spoofing traffic. Therefore, it is highly recommended to improve the
      accuracy and robustness upon current SAV by using TOAs.</t>
